/*
Order Service:
This must be written in Java
This is the service's public facing endpoint. It is used to 
create users and products, but also to handle orders. 

Implement an order microservice responsible for handling customer orders.
An order should have attributes such as id, user_id, product_id, quantity, and order_date.
All endpoints on this service are: 
/order Provide endpoints for order creation, retrieval, and cancellation.
/user Provide endpoints for user functionality
/product Provide endpoints for product functionality

/order POST API (for A1)
{
    "command": "place order",
    "user_id": 1,
    "product_id": 2,
    "quantity": 3
}

==> if the product and the user exists and has a quantity of >= this quantity in stock, then quantity in DB is reduced
by this quantity and success is returned.

All communication from OrderService MUST go to ISCS which will route and load balance the requests.

Note: this means that to place an order, you may have to first make a GET request, then an "update order" POST request.
